# FeeFlow
FeeFlow is a MERN stack student fees management portal with Clerk authentication and Stripe payments. Students view balances, make payments, and download statements. Admins manage students and fee records. Built with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS. A responsive dummy project to demonstrate my skills.
